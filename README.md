Members Only

This is a project from The Odin Project (https://theodinproject.com)

In this project, I built an exclusive clubhouse where members can write embarrassing posts about non-members. Inside the clubhouse, members can see who the author of a post is but, outside, they can only see the story and wonder who wrote it.

This was a practice project to introduce me to Devise gem.

I created the Post model/controller and associated views.

Created a form to create a post

Used Devise to create the User model with authentications

Changed the Devise User model to accept a name

Created the logic to display user name if logged in
